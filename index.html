            <h2>Market Analysis</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Market Opportunity</h3>
                <p>RapidBuild taps into the enormous software development market estimated at over $200B, addressing a critical gap in timely delivery and cost efficiency. With increasing demand for faster turnaround and quality in custom software, the platform targets businesses ranging from startups to established companies seeking agile development solutions.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Competitive Landscape</h3>
                <p>While platforms like Upwork and Toptal offer access to freelance talent, RapidBuild differentiates by embedding AI tools to drastically reduce development times. Traditional agencies lack the agility and cost-advantages offered by this model.</p>
                <div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>Upwork</h4>
                        <a href="https://www.upwork.com" target="_blank">Visit website</a>
                        <p>A large freelance marketplace that connects businesses with independent professionals, though not specifically focused on rapid AI-powered software development.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>Toptal</h4>
                        <a href="https://www.toptal.com" target="_blank">Visit website</a>
                        <p>A marketplace for top freelance engineers and designers, emphasizing quality but not necessarily speed enabled by AI.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>Traditional Software Agencies</h4>
                        <a href="" target="_blank">Visit website</a>
                        <p>Large development firms and consulting agencies that offer custom software solutions but often suffer from long turnaround times and high costs.</p>

            <div>
                <h3>Go-to-Market Strategy</h3>

            <h2>Assessment Metrics</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Market Potential (Weight: 40%)</h3>
                <div>Score: 85</div>
                <p>The market opportunity is extremely large, citing a $200B+ traditional agency market. With every business needing custom software and the gap between delivery times (months vs days) presenting enormous unmet demand, the revenue potential and market timing are very favorable.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Execution Feasibility (Weight: 30%)</h3>
                <div>Score: 75</div>
                <p>Building a marketplace that integrates experienced developers with AI tools requires complex technical integrations, resource allocation, and robust infrastructure. However, leveraging a pool of seasoned engineers and standardized processes reduces development risk, although careful onboarding and quality control are necessary.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Competitive Advantage (Weight: 30%)</h3>
                <div>Score: 80</div>
                <p>The unique proposition of combining high-end freelance talent with AI-powered rapid development creates a defensible position. The focus on structured PRDs, fixed-scope projects, and integrated AI tools builds a quality guarantee that is hard for traditional agencies or offshore services to mimic. The barrier to entry is moderately high due to skills and process standardization.</p>
